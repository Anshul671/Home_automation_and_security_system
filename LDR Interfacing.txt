For controlling an LCD display based on the reading of a light sensor (connected 
to pin 13) and a variable mov. 
 
lcd.setCursor(8,0);: Set the cursor position on the LCD display to column 8 and row 
0. 
 
lcd.print("L:");: Print the string "L:" on the LCD display. This is likely a label 
indicating the following light sensor status. 
 
if(digitalRead(13)==LOW): Check the state of the digital pin 13 (connected to the 
light sensor). If it reads LOW (indicating that the light sensor is detecting low light 
or darkness): 
 
a. lcd.print("Yes");: Print the string "Yes" on the LCD display. This indicates that 
the light sensor is detecting low light. 
 
b. digitalWrite(10,HIGH);: Set the digital pin 10 to HIGH. This line of code is likely 
controlling a connected device (such as an LED) to indicate the low light condition. 
 
c. Blynk.virtualWrite(V0, 255);: Send a virtual write command to the Blynk 
platform, writing a value of 255 to virtual pin V0. This can be used to update a 
widget or trigger an action in the Blynk mobile app. 
 
d. Blynk.virtualWrite(V6, 0);: Send a virtual write command to the Blynk platform, 
writing a value of 0 to virtual pin V6. Similar to the previous line, this can be used 
to update a widget or trigger an action in the Blynk app. 
 
else: If the condition in step 3 is not met (indicating that the light sensor is not 
detecting low light): 
 
a. lcd.print("NO ");: Print the string "NO " on the LCD display. This indicates that 
the light sensor is not detecting low light.
